The Supreme Court did rule that the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II was constitutional, and the ruling does still technically stand, as it has not been revisited in the years since. It is feasible that an Administration determined to repeat such an action could use that history as a justification. At the same time, however, that wartime action has officially been acknowledged as a dark stain on America’s legacy. Knowing the facts of what happened makes it all the more clear why the suggesting of repeating such a time is so shocking.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what happened:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Almost immediately after Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941—75 years ago next month—many Japanese-Americans found that their neighbors and representatives quickly turned against them, lumping them in with the Japanese in Japan who were now an enemy, fearing that homeland ties would lead them to sabotage or treason.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“A superpatriot chopped down four Japanese cherry trees along the Tidal Basin in Washington; the Tennessee State Department of Purchasing declared ‘open season on Japs, no licenses required,’ and an elderly Japanese man and wife were shot to death in their beds in El Centro, Calif.,” TIME <a href=#>later</a> reported. “As American military losses increased in the Pacific and American morale dipped at home, rumors of Japanese-American fifth-column activity raged along the Pacific Coast. The very fact that no sabotage had occurred—or ever did occur—was viewed with alarm. ‘It is a sign that the blow is well organized,’ warned Pundit Walter Lippmann darkly, ‘and that it is held back until it can be struck with maximum effect.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Within days after the attack, the FBI and other authorities had <a href=#>rounded up </a>thousands of “enemy aliens.” The U.S. was home to, by TIME’s 1941 count, nearly 79,642 native-born Americans of Japanese descent, who watched the round-up in panic: Would Americans know the difference between them and the enemy?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The answer was, sadly, no.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In February of 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the infamous <a href=# rel=noopener>Executive Order 9066</a>, which authorized the military to designate certain regions as “military areas” from which “any or all persons may be excluded.” It was, as TIME <a href=#>summed</a> it up, “not martial law—not quite.” Much of the West Coast, home to a large Japanese population, was promptly declared just such a military area, and people with Japanese ancestry were the ones to be excluded.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Support for the idea was, at high levels, fairly widespread. (Notable exceptions were Sen. Robert Taft and the American Civil Liberties Union, who <a href=# rel=noopener>spoke out</a> against it.) One of the Army officers who was responsible for the relocation was even <a href=#>given the Distinguished Service Medal</a> that November for the work he had done to oversee the evacuation of more than 100,000 Japanese people and Nisei—the American children of Japanese immigrants—to ten “permanent projects” in the Western half of the U.S. under the charge of the War Relocation Authority. The camps were cramped and unprepared to house large populations during cold winters, and the property left behind by the evacuees was often essentially looted by those who had once been their neighbors.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most of the people subjected to this forced relocation to the camps were American citizens. (Among those interned were future Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta and Star Trek actor George Takei.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1944, in the case Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court heard the case of Fred Korematsu, an Oakland native who attempted to resist the relocation, only to be convicted of breaking military law. The court <a href=# rel=noopener>held</a> that his conviction could stand, and that the evacuation order—due to the extraordinary circumstances of war—was constitutional. (In a dissent, Justice Robert H. Jackson—who would later serve as prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials—<a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a> that the decision was a “loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.”)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It did not take very long after the war for the internment of Japanese-Americans to go from being seen as a necessity to what TIME in 1961 <a href=#>called</a> “an ugly footnote in American history,” given the admirable service of many Japanese-Americans who fought for the U.S. during the war and the complete lack of concrete evidence that the population posed any actual danger.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Choose any one exclusive book from the TIME History collection with your paid subscription to TIME.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1980, the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established by Congress in an attempt to come to terms with what had happened. The <a href=#>hearings</a> conducted by the commission gave those who had endured the camps a chance to tell the nation what they had lived through: poor medical care and malnutrition, the separation of families, and the total loss of an estimated $400 million in property—of which they were repaid only $38.5 million by the government.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The commission also examined a question with an answer that was only too obviously racial: if the reason for the camps was wartime necessity, why hadn’t Italians and Germans received the same treatment?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1983, the commission issued its <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a>, stating for the record that:</p><figure class=text-left readability=31><p>The broad historical causes which shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership. Widespread ignorance of Japanese-Americans contributed to a policy conceived in haste and executed in an atmosphere of fear and anger at Japan.</p><p>A grave injustice was done to American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry who, without individual review or any probative evidence against them, were excluded, removed and detained by the United States during World War II.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And, shortly after, Fred Korematsu was officially cleared. Using materials from a Freedom of Information Act request—documents that showed that the FBI knew there was no serious evidence that the Japanese population of the U.S. was helping the enemy—he had returned to court. (Later, in 2011, the Solicitor General’s office <a href=# rel=noopener>confessed</a> confessed to having erred in withholding information that would suggest that there was no real threat.) The Justice Department did not specifically admit having done wrong, but decided to support Korematsu’s claim that his original conviction should be overturned.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As TIME <a href=#>pointed out,</a> the Supreme Court precedent would still stand, but the judge who cleared Korematsu’s conviction declared in her <a href=# rel=noopener>ruling</a> that, in the words of the <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a> of the Commission on Wartime Relocation, “Korematsu lies overruled in the court of history.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And, she <a href=# rel=noopener>added</a>, the <a href=# rel=noopener>still-standing</a> Korematsu ruling was one that all Americans ought to remember, especially in times of national turmoil:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29><p>As historical precedent it stands as a constant caution that in times of war or declared military necessity our institutions must be vigilant in protecting constitutional guarantees. It stands as a caution that in times of distress the shield of military necessity and national security must not be used to protect governmental actions from close scrutiny and accountability. It stands as a caution that in times of international hostility and antagonisms our institutions, legislative, executive and judicial, must be prepared to exercise their authority to protect all citizens from the petty fears and prejudices that are so easily aroused.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1988, President Reagan <a href=# rel=noopener>signed</a> the Civil Liberties Act, which offered an official apology and provided restitution of $20,000 to every survivor. “No payment can make up for those lost years,” Reagan said during his <a href=# rel=noopener>remarks</a> about the bill. “Here, we admit a wrong.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last December, Donald Trump <a href=#>told TIME</a> that he could not say whether he would have supported the internment of Japanese-Americans. Though he said he did not like the idea, he was not sure what he would have done at the time, given that, as he said then, “war is tough.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbWdpg3l8jqasrKSZonqzscaiqq2qqWK3orzAp5ysnV2eu7Wx0aeknqakZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmuslim-registry-japanese-internment.html&text=Muslim%20Registry%20Compared%20to%20Japanese%20InternmentWhat%20to%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmuslim-registry-japanese-internment.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmuslim-registry-japanese-internment.html&title=Muslim%20Registry%20Compared%20to%20Japanese%20InternmentWhat%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmuslim-registry-japanese-internment.html&title=Muslim%20Registry%20Compared%20to%20Japanese%20InternmentWhat%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmuslim-registry-japanese-internment.html&title=Muslim%20Registry%20Compared%20to%20Japanese%20InternmentWhat%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmuslim-registry-japanese-internment.html&description=Muslim%20Registry%20Compared%20to%20Japanese%20InternmentWhat%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mean-girls-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Review: The New Mean Girls Overworks a Smart Classic Comedy">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meet-agt-golden-buzzer-dance-crew-brent-street-project-30.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet 'AGT' Golden Buzzer Dance Crew Brent Street">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
