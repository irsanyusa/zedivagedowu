Early&nbsp;on, his football-talented kid discovered an&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;acting. Bomer’s upbringing was filled with affection, and his parents provided a&nbsp;calm and healthy environment for their children. Due to&nbsp;his rather sheltered upbringing, Bomer was unaware of&nbsp;his real sexuality until he&nbsp;read Larry Kramer’s <i>The Normal Heart</i>.</p><p>After reading the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>book</a>, which was about the struggles of&nbsp;2&nbsp;gay lovers (an&nbsp;activist and a&nbsp;reporter who wrote for the <i>New York Times</i>) and the unfair treatment of&nbsp;men who loved each other, a&nbsp;new man was born.

I’m straight, that’s how&nbsp;I identify.’ And it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big, nice, sweet moment,” Bomer said at&nbsp;the time.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bomer said</a> of&nbsp;his twins, Henry and Walker, who were 11&nbsp;years old then, “We&nbsp;would be&nbsp;there with open arms no&nbsp;matter what their sexual orientation&nbsp;is.”</p><p><h2>His grandparents taught him the notion of&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/92b/bb7/40cbe255f8af2c7817c312a65e.png><p>Halls was thrilled that his husband cared about their family so&nbsp;much, and it&nbsp;made him proud to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Bomer’s mate. He&nbsp;has nothing to&nbsp;worry about, as&nbsp;his partner is&nbsp;working hard to&nbsp;make their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> work and keep it&nbsp;together for good. The star of&nbsp;<i>The Normal Heart</i> said that it’s his grandparents who taught him how to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;marriage work.</p><p>Bomer wanted to&nbsp;know what made them happy, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;asked his grandparents what the secret was to&nbsp;their happy marriage. They told him that it&nbsp;was all about taking things one day at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time. This has been the main thing that has kept his love for Halls strong. They also put the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>happiness and safety</a> of&nbsp;their family first, which makes them a&nbsp;great couple to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;to.</p><p>No&nbsp;matter if&nbsp;a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;gay or&nbsp;straight, a&nbsp;happy family will raise a&nbsp;wonderful child.
