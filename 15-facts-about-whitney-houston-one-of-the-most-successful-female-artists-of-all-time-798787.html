She <a href=#>sang</a> at&nbsp;church. Later, she began performing with her mother (who was a&nbsp;singer in&nbsp;clubs) as&nbsp;a&nbsp;backup singer.</p></li><li readability=3.9029126213592><p>However, it&nbsp;was working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>model</a> that became the future star’s first real job. Whitney, who had a&nbsp;gorgeous body shape, couldn’t go&nbsp;unnoticed and she appeared on&nbsp;the covers of&nbsp;popular magazines.</p></li></ul><ul><li>She was heavily <a href=#>determined</a> to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;singer. She was actually a&nbsp;top contender to&nbsp;play Sondra, the eldest daughter on&nbsp;The Cosby Show, but turned down the part so&nbsp;she could focus on&nbsp;her <a href=#>music</a>.</li></ul><p><h2>How Whitney attained the status of&nbsp;celebrity and superstar</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e49/e4d/426fac5be19781cbbe45dfeaa9.jpg><ul readability=20.502577319588><li readability=5.9357601713062><p>In&nbsp;the ’80s, Whitney firmly decided that she wanted to&nbsp;build her career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer. She was signing contracts with recording studios and participating in&nbsp;television shows. But she only managed to&nbsp;become famous within small groups of&nbsp;people. Her true fame came to&nbsp;her after the release of&nbsp;the <a href=#>album</a>, Whitney Houston. Her single, “You Give Good Love” took top positions in&nbsp;the charts, and people started buying the album and talking about the new star.</p></li><li readability=3.8466076696165><p>There were many successful songs later&nbsp;on, but the singer attained <strong>superstar status </strong>in&nbsp;1992 <strong>after the release of&nbsp;The Bodyguard movie</strong>. The audience welcomed the romantic story with delight, but critics smashed the singer’s acting abilities to&nbsp;smithereens. Whitney then won a&nbsp;Golden Raspberry Award nomination for “<a href=#>Worst Actress</a>.”</p></li><li readability=6.4664246823956><p>The ballad, “I&nbsp;Will Always Love You” from the movie was wildly successful! Not only did it&nbsp;become a&nbsp;world hit and the <a href=#>most-sold</a> single among female singers in&nbsp;<a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> history, but it&nbsp;was also considered a&nbsp;hymn of&nbsp;love. This song won <a href=#>multiple awards</a>. Believe it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, the hit song is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;<a href=#>cover version</a> of&nbsp;Dolly Parton’s (a&nbsp;country singer) song that was bought especially for the movie. This might be&nbsp;surprising, but Elvis Presley also tried to&nbsp;buy the rights to&nbsp;the song. Unfortunately for him, Dolly turned his offer down.</p></li><li readability=5.9099099099099><p>She also ran into problems when giving her creative input to&nbsp;various movie roles. In&nbsp;the late 1980s, she was heavily attached to&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie adaptation of&nbsp;Dreamgirls and was cast as&nbsp;the character of&nbsp;<a href=#>Deena</a>, but plans fell through when she wanted to&nbsp;perform, “And I&nbsp;Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” another character’s song.</p></li><li readability=6.8447893569845><p>That said, she wasn’t necessarily a&nbsp;diva when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;other actors. When she became attached to&nbsp;a&nbsp;remake of&nbsp;Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella, she was originally cast as&nbsp;<a href=#>Cinderella </a>herself. Unfortunately, by&nbsp;the time the project went into production, she felt she had aged out of&nbsp;the role and agreed to&nbsp;play the fairy godmother instead, and suggested that Moesha star Brandy play the part. She was also a&nbsp;co-producer of&nbsp;the film.</p></li><li readability=0.81868131868132><p>Whitney was also capable of&nbsp;working behind the scenes, serving as&nbsp;a<a href=#>&nbsp;producer and executive producer</a> on&nbsp;popular children’s films like The Cheetah Girls and The Princess Diaries.</p></li></ul><p><h2>There were almost no&nbsp;outsiders on&nbsp;the singer’s team.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a28/ce2/f11e5353bea17dc5379483c2eb.jpg><ul readability=6.6035767511177><li readability=7.7213930348259><p>It&nbsp;was mainly the singer’s <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> that was her team. However, at&nbsp;one time, her father <a href=#>sued</a> her because he&nbsp;believed she had violated business obligations. He&nbsp;demanded $100 million from her, but after 2&nbsp;years, the lawsuit was dismissed. A&nbsp;few years after the death of&nbsp;her father, Whitney Houston’s stepmother also <a href=#>sued</a> her, demanding that she return the money she received under the insurance.</p></li><li readability=5.4626865671642><p>Nevertheless, the singer believed that having close <a href=#>people</a> on&nbsp;her team was a&nbsp;good decision. Her <a href=#>father</a> even started a&nbsp;company, John Houston Enterprise, just to&nbsp;manage her career. One of&nbsp;<a href=#>her brothers</a>, Gary Garland, also performed as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her back-up vocalists.</p></li></ul><p><h2>Her personal life wasn’t simple.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18d/013/706cea542fa54b78bb9366caee.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Whitney Houston and her husband Bobby Brown</p><ul readability=11.711851278079><li readability=6.803738317757><p>There were many rumors that swirled around the singer’s personal life. For example, it&nbsp;was said that she was secretly <a href=#>in&nbsp;love</a> with Michael Jackson and that he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;love with her too, but something prevented them from being together. Also, Robyn Crawford, Whitney’s close friend and impresario, <a href=#>said</a> that there was a&nbsp;love connection between her and the singer and that Whitney was a&nbsp;person with untraditional desires.</p></li><li readability=0.94262295081967><p>Before Bobby Brown became her husband, Whitney had <a href=#>affairs</a> with football player Randall Cunningham and actor Eddie Murphy.</p></li><li readability=3.9098591549296><p>The marriage of&nbsp;Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown lasted for 15&nbsp;years. Journalists wrote that the singer used to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;good reputation before she was with him. All because their marriage was accompanied by&nbsp;incessant <a href=#>scandals</a>, the spouses were brought to&nbsp;justice for cases involving illegal substances, and the singer accused her husband of&nbsp;adultery.</p></li><li readability=5.9373368146214><p>Despite all the disturbances, the couple had a&nbsp;daughter together named Bobbi Kristina. Whitney adored her daughter, though the girl went through some problems in&nbsp;her teenage years. After many years of&nbsp;scandals and arrests, Whitney decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>file</a> for divorce. 14-year-old Kristina decided to&nbsp;stay and live with her mother, even though Bobby Brown wanted to&nbsp;get custody of&nbsp;her.</p></li></ul><p><h2>Whitney Houston and her daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ec/250/c0757e539ab7c18e8f0e993194.jpg><ul readability=5.1247755834829><li readability=3.6016597510373><p>Whitney Houston <a href=#>died</a> in&nbsp;February 2012 under mysterious circumstances.
