I suppose they do so because of his successful career. Well, I am here to put an end to these rumours. The rapper was born on the 30th of April 1992. Interestingly, this month is his birthday month, and he will be turning 27 years old. It is unbelievable how much success and wealth he has gathered at such a young age.</p><h2>Who is Travis Scott?</h2><p class=align-left>As I have mentioned earlier, the man lived with his grandmother in Missouri city. However, he again moved to stay with his parents back in Texas. Also, I suppose you probably have an idea that he dropped out of college after 2 years, to pursue his dream in music as a full-time job.</p><h2>Travis Scott height</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4ef3e1bf47e71110.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>DaBaby net worth: how did the rapper earn all that wealth?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You will agree with me that the rapper has an amazing athletic body. How tall is Travis Scott though? Well, he is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">5 ft 10 inches</a>— approximately 178 cm. His weight is about 67 kg while his chest measurements are 40 inches. He stands out as a rapper with distinct features that include his many tattoos, short dyed dreadlocks, and gold plated teeth. This physique has given him the opportunity to promote brands like Puma, Sprite, Reebok and Beats Audio Wireless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fb3c7d803796b65f.jpg><h2>Travis Scott net worth and career</h2><p class=align-left>Travis officially entered into the music industry in 2008 though he had an interest in music from childhood. His very first EP was released in 2009, just a year after he started working professionally. At that time, the young man was working with his friend Chris Holloway. He also worked with OG Chess for a short time before he moved to Los Angeles in 2011. While in Los Angeles, he was signed by Kanye West and Epic Records in 2012.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/927bdcacf8db8f60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lil Baby net worth: how has the rapper earned all his riches?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In early 2012, he was signed by Grand Hustle Imprint, which released his first mixtape ‘Owl Pharaoh.’ In the mixtape, Travis collaborated with artists such as 2Chains, ASAP Ferg, Wale, and Meek Mill. Fans liked the album, and it was nominated as the best hip-hop mixtape on BET awards.</p><p class=align-left>Rodeo’s studio album was released in September 2015 by both T.I’s Grand Hustle and Epic Records. The first song was a collaboration that included Big Sean and The 1975. It performed, significantly, well on the Billboard 200 since it was #3. Some of the album’s singles you can sing along include: ‘3500’, Antidote and Nightcrawler.</p><p class=align-left>Scott’s 2nd album was released almost a year later; the singles featured in the album include ‘Pick up the phone’ and ‘wonderful.’ In 2017, his mighty collaborations with Quavo and Liz Uzi Vert put him on the map. He also released an album called Huncho Jack.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/27d21de417f49348.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Garcia: Facts about his boxing career, age, family, and net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Grammy Awards 2019: List of winners that won their categories</p><p class=align-left>It is incredible how the rapper has been working tirelessly to release an album every year.

RIAA has rated the album platinum, and it is number #1 on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hot 100 Billboard</a>. The story behind this album is quite an interesting one. Actually, it is about the Astroworld demolition in Houston. The album seeks to create a movement to restore it so that children can play and enjoy their childhood. Astroworld features a series of singles and collaboration like ‘Sicko mode,' which has over 165 million views on YouTube.</p><p class=align-left>Wait, how much is Travis Scott worth?
