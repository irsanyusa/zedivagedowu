I tried to include mowers with various engine types, fuel sources, and powers. I also considered the mower deck size, whether additional attachments or replacement parts are available, and features like the cutting height range. Finally, I looked at features that make the mower easy and comfortable to use, like the seat design and transmission type, as well as the mower’s overall price.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-riding-lawn-mower>What to consider when buying a riding lawn mower</h2><h3>Cutting width</h3><p>Gavin Warwick, founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Boise Landscaping Company</a>, notes that one of the most important factors is the mower’s cutting width and the size of your lawn. “If your lawn is more than two acres, you shouldn’t be looking at anything with less than 48 inches of cutting width,” he says. He recommends a cutting width of at least 45 inches for lawns between one and two acres. A cutting width of at least 40 inches is suitable for lawns from half to one acre, while a 30- or 35-inch width mower will work for very small lawns.</p><p>Keep in mind that cutting width will affect the amount of time you spend mowing your lawn. A cutting width that is too small will mean mowing takes longer, and since you’ll need to repeatedly mow during the course of the season, you’ll be wasting a lot of time with a mower that’s too small for the job.</p><p>Don’t forget to consider how you plan to store the mower when you choose its size, too. If you have a smaller shed or limited space in your garage, you’ll need to make sure that the mower’s dimensions will fit in the space.</p><h3>Mower engine type and power</h3><p>Warwick notes that the mower’s engine type and power also need to be suitable for your lawn. Both single-cylinder and twin-cylinder mowers exist. Twin-cylinder mowers are more powerful, but they’re also more expensive. If you can afford it, Warwick recommends choosing a twin-cylinder mower.</p><p>”For engine power, if your lawn is larger than two acres, you’ll want at least 25 horsepower (HP),” says Warwick. He says that 21 HP is suitable for lawns from one to two acres, while 18 HP will suffice for a half to one acre. A 15 HP mower should be capable of handling a lawn that’s less than half acre.</p><h3>Fuel type</h3><p>Consider the ideal fuel type for your mower, too. Gas mowers are highly popular, but you’ll need to buy and store gasoline and perform engine oil maintenance and changes. Electric mowers are increasingly popular, but have limited battery ranges before you’ll need to recharge. If you’re thinking about buying an <a rel=alternate href=#>electric lawn mower</a>, review the size of your yard and be sure to buy a mower with a large enough battery runtime so that you can mow the yard in one go.</p><h3>Ease of maintenance</h3><p>Scott McLeod, owner of <a rel=nofollow href=#>McLeod Landscaping Inc.</a>, has over three decades of landscaping experience. He explains that it’s important to choose a riding mower that is designed for easy maintenance. “Designs that allow easy access to the engine, filter replacements, and blade maintenance can save a lot of headaches and money, over time.”</p><h3>Additional features</h3><p>As you shop, you’ll find that ride-on mowers have a wide range of additional features such as seat suspension, extra comfortable seat designs, Bluetooth connectivity, and the ability to charge your phone as you mow.. These features can be nice to have, but they will also drive up the mower’s price. Think about what matters most to you, as well as your budget, when deciding what features are worth paying more for.</p><h2 id=riding-lawn-mower-maintenance-for-longevity>Riding lawn mower maintenance for longevity</h2><p>Warwick notes that riding lawn mowers require significant maintenance. He highlights the importance of sharpening the blades at least a couple of times during each season, cleaning the mower up after each use to help prevent rust, and regularly inspecting the engine oil and air filters. Other maintenance needs, like emptying fuel at the end of the season, changing out engine oil, and replacing worn belts need to be done less frequently. While you can choose to do the maintenance yourself, many retailers and mechanics also offer mower maintenance and repair services.</p><h2 id=best-time-to-buy-a-riding-lawn-mower>Best time to buy a riding lawn mower</h2><p>Warwick explains that it’s often best to buy a riding lawn mower during the off-season, especially in late fall to early winter, since stores often offer discounts to clear out old inventory. However, your selection may be limited during these times, and it might be hard to find the specific mower that you’re looking for. Buying in the spring means you’ll have access to all of the newer models, and retailers may offer discounts or special deals. Also, riding mowers are also often available during end-of-summer clearances, when traditional <a rel=alternate href=#>lawn mowers</a> also go on deep discount.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What brand of riding mower is the most reliable?</h3><p>McLeod feels that <a rel=nofollow href=#>Husqvarna</a> is the most reliable riding lawn mower brand. “Their models have consistently performed well for us across a range of tasks and conditions, from basic lawn care to more demanding landscape maintenance tasks,” he explains. “In terms of durability, they’ve proven themselves time and again, handling the rigorous demands of commercial landscaping without significant downtime.” He believes that a well-maintained <a rel=nofollow href=#>Husqvarna mower</a> can last longer than less durable machines.</p><h3>What is the best type of riding mower?</h3><p>McLeod recommends a zero-turn riding mower for properties that require precise maneuverability. “These mowers are unmatched in their ability to navigate around obstacles such as trees, garden beds, and other landscaping features efficiently,” he says. “Their speed and agility drastically reduce mowing time, which has been a game-changer for our operations, especially in extensive commercial spaces.”</p><h3>What is the life expectancy of a riding lawn mower?</h3><p>“A riding lawn mower should easily last at least five years, and can go up to 10 or even 15 years with proper maintenance,” says Warwick. To maximize the life expectancy of your riding lawn mower, ensure proper care and maintenance to be able to see that type of longevity.</p><h3>What’s the difference between a riding lawn mower and a lawn tractor?</h3><p>Warwick explains that while riding lawn mowers and lawn tractors can look very similar, their abilities are different. Tractors tend to be more powerful, have more features, and are larger than riding lawn mowers. They can also be paired with attachments, like lawn carts, making them more versatile than riding mowers.</p><h3>How fast do riding lawn mowers go?</h3><p>The speed that a riding lawn mower can reach will depend on the type of mower, says Warwick. “The fastest type, zero-turn mowers, can go up to 10 miles-per-hour, and sometimes even faster,” Warwick explains.</p><h3>How do you transport a riding mower?</h3><p>You can transport a riding lawn mower using a utility trailer. Warwick recommends securing the mower with tie-down straps, removing the key and disconnecting the battery so it can’t accidentally start, and turning off the fuel supply.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lop6xqrrGZqOar55iurDDxKtm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-riding-lawn-mower.html&text=Best%20Riding%20Lawn%20Mower%20to%20Keep%20Your%20Yard%20Looking%20Good&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-riding-lawn-mower.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-riding-lawn-mower.html&title=Best%20Riding%20Lawn%20Mower%20to%20Keep%20Your%20Yard%20Looking%20Good" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-riding-lawn-mower.html&title=Best%20Riding%20Lawn%20Mower%20to%20Keep%20Your%20Yard%20Looking%20Good" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-riding-lawn-mower.html&title=Best%20Riding%20Lawn%20Mower%20to%20Keep%20Your%20Yard%20Looking%20Good" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-riding-lawn-mower.html&description=Best%20Riding%20Lawn%20Mower%20to%20Keep%20Your%20Yard%20Looking%20Good" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1604236-chelsea-wrexham-phil-parkinson-delivers-subtle-jibe-enzo-marescas-side-preseason-draw.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chelsea vs Wrexham: Phil Parkinson Delivers Subtle Jibe at Enzo Marescas Side After Preseason Dra">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./barbie-tv-show-neftlix-a-touch-of-magic-1235703282.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barbie TV Series A Touch of Magic Coming to Netflix">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
