Aside from acting, Vayntrub is an outspoken activist and a comedian. She is the co-founder of "Can't Do Nothing", an organisation that raises awareness of the refugee crisis in Europe.</p><h2>Milana Vayntrub’s relationship timeline</h2><p class=align-left>Since she made her acting debut in 1995, Milana has worked hard to keep her personal life private. She once mentioned that she fears revealing her romantic partner to the public. Still, she has generated much interest in her dating life among her fans. Here are the guys the actress has dated and been rumoured to be with.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d38d4e6b818b04cd.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sabrina Carpenter’s boyfriend timeline: who has she dated?</span></p></a><h3>Milana Vayntrub and John Mayer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d38d4e6b818b04cd.png><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><i>Сheck out news that is picked exactly<strong> for YOU</strong> ➡️ find the <strong>“Recommended for you”</strong> block on the home page and enjoy!</i></p><p class=align-left>The actress has had only one publicised romantic relationship. In 2006, she was rumoured to be dating <a href=#>American singer</a> and songwriter John Mayer. According <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to reports</a>, their relationship was more of a casual fling than a serious relationship. Even so, Milana Vayntrub and John Mayer are said to have been involved for close to a year ending in 2007.</p><p class=align-left>However, the <i>Your Body Is a Wonderland</i> singer was also rumoured to simultaneously have multiple other romantic involvements. In addition to Vayntrub, he was linked to Jessica Simpson, Cameron Diaz and Minka Kelly, all between 2006 and 2007. Neither Mayer nor Vayntrub have ever addressed the rumours about their relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bfbd4a3cabb14ab2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jessica Stellina Morrison biography: who is Gino D'Acampo's wife?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The relationship between Milana Vayntrub and John Mayer attracted a lot of backlash for the singer. At the time, the <a href=#>stand-up comedian</a> was 19 years old while Mayer was 28. Their age difference raised a lot of eyebrows. It also got Mayer a lot of hate when he later dated other significantly younger women, including Taylor <a href=#>Swift</a>.</p><h3>Is Milana Vayntrub married?</h3><p class=align-left>Since her breakup from John Mayer, Milana has largely kept her personal life private. She revealed that she is indeed married and has a son with her husband. However, she does not share photos of her family online. She also doesn’t go out with them publicly, so the identities of Milana Vayntrub’s husband and son remain unknown.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><i>Meditative Story</i> podcast</a>, Milana revealed that she and her husband were intent on being present in their son’s life. The <a href=#>American actress</a> talked about the difficulties of growing up with a long-distance father. She said she did not want the same for her son, so she and her husband would do their best to be active and available parents.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0f591be6e605571f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is known about Ranjeet Singh Dehal, the ex-husband of Ranvir Singh?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While writing about her husband and son, Milana revealed that she had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">terminated a pregnancy</a> ten years earlier. She added that she was with her first boyfriend out of college at the time and couldn’t afford to raise a baby. Vayntrub used her story to champion women's rights, saying she was glad she had a baby when she was ready.</p><h3>What is Milana Vayntrub’s sexuality?</h3><p class=align-left>Milana does not divulge a lot of information about her dating life. Instead, <a href=#>the activist</a> mostly shares photos with her friends, co-workers, and pet <a href=#>dog</a>. Her secrecy led fans to come up with many theories, and some suspected that she was either gay or bi.</p><p class=align-left>The rumours started when she publicly declared her support for the LGBTQ+ community. Since Milana never talks about the men she dates, fans concluded that she dated the ladies she posted on social media.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c3e54966ca6aaefd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cindy Deangelis Grossman biography: who is Herschel Walker’s wife?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The rumours were further fuelled when she hung out with Liz Elverenli, a television writer and producer who is openly queer. Milana has never directly addressed the gossip, but she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared a tweet</a> in which she said Liz wished she was “more gay”. Additionally, there is no proof that she’s gay, and she has been in two confirmed heterosexual relationships.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><li>Is Milana Vayntrub single? No, AT&T Lily Adams is married.
