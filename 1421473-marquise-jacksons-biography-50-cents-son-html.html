As of June 2021, Marquise Jackson's age is 23.</p><p class=align-left>The 23-year-old was born in California to his dad Curtis Jackson and his mum Shaniqua Tompkins. His parents broke up when he was about 10. He has a half-brother named Sire (from Curtis' relationship with <a href=#>Daphne Joy</a>) and a sister named Mia.</p><p class=align-left>50 Cent's son Marquise was interested in and played basketball in his early years. In 2014, he was a star prep school player at St. John's Military Academy. He was also interested in <a href=#>music</a> from an early age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3f0be430c55fef5a.jpg><h3>Marquise Jackson's career</h3><p class=align-left>Marquise Jackson (25 Cent) has taken the same path as his father and is forging a career as a rapper. He began his rap career in 2017 with his first single titled <i>Different</i>. He has other titles such as <i>Follow Your Heart</i> and <i>Just Another Freestyle</i>. His songs are centred <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">around his strained relationship</a> with his father.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/361767951034523f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rapper Key Glock’s biography: age, height, real name, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The young rapper has also explored acting and has appeared in two documentaries about his dad. He also acted in the movie <i>Dope Fiend</i> in 2017.</p><h3>Marquise Jackson's net worth</h3><p class=align-left>The young rapper's net worth is not known. However, he is thought to be living a comfortable life as his career is taking shape and has also been provided for by his father growing up.</p><h3>Relationship between 50 Cent and his son</h3><p class=align-left>50 Cent and son Marquise have been in a complicated father-son relationship. Their relationship took a negative turn when Marquise was only ten years old. They have since said bad things about each other on various platforms, including social media and the press.</p><p class=align-left>The situation wasn't always that way, as <a href=# rel=noopener>50 Cent</a> had previously shared that being a father to his son was a motivation for him and changed his priorities. He even had a tattoo with his son's name on his bicep. He said that the toughest thing about breaking up with Shaniqua was that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he could not see</a> his son as often as he wanted.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/53a5467afd1cfdaa.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lil Bibby's biography: age, height, net worth, son, where is he now?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ea93b5c86e9a752e.jpg><h3>What happened between 50 Cent and his son?</h3><p class=align-left>His parents' bitter split-up partly influenced 50 Cent's son Marquise's beef with his dad. His father had a $4 million mansion located in Long Island, which Shaniqua claimed was promised to her. After Curtis and Shaniqua broke up, Curtis evicted her from the house.</p><p class=align-left>On May 30, 2008, when Curtis was out filming a movie in Arizona, the house was burnt to the ground. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blaze seemed suspicious</a> even to the authorities. Shaniqua claimed that her ex was trying to kill her and her son.</p><p class=align-left>50 Cent's son Marquise Jackson picked up the feud between his parents and chose to side with his mum. His dad messaged him in 2012, threatening to remove him from <a href=#>his will</a>. Curtis was also absent at Marquise's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">high school graduation</a> in 2014.</p><p class=align-left>Curtis seems not to be bothered by the bad blood between him and his son. He shares in his book that it's too late for their relationship to work and that he has tried so long to make it work to no avail. He feels that his son Marquise has a huge <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sense of entitlement</a>, which he doesn't like.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/699584e0b0ca6408.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tommy Vext’s biography: age, height, nationality, Bad Wolves</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When commenting on a photo of his son and a son of one of the men who had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">allegedly planned to kill</a> him at some point, Curtis tweeted that he wouldn't mind if either of the two in the photo was hit by a bus. The sentiments show just how bad the relationship between the father-son duo is.</p><p class=align-left>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Rap-Up</a> in 2017, Marquise Jackson, 50 Cent's son, shared that he felt differently about his dad as he got older because he observed certain patterns that affected their relationship negatively. He used to see his dad as a superman before then.</p><p class=align-left>Marquise Jackson is a young rapper and actor.
