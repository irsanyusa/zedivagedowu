It typically runs through the weekend into Cyber Monday, which falls on November 27, when online deals (similar to Black Friday) go live for online steals and deals.</p><p>However, if you’ve started shopping early, you’re not alone. Trends show that many consumers start their holiday shopping before November—according to the <a rel=nofollow href=#>National Retail Federation</a> (NRF), “Almost half (46%) of consumers started their holiday shopping before November last year (2022), up from 39% in 2019, and this year is shaping up to follow the same trend.”</p><p>That may be why this year, early Black Friday sales have started as early as the first week of November.</p><h3>What deals should I expect on Black Friday?</h3><p>Early Black Friday deals are slowly rolling out from major retailers, offering markdowns in categories like appliances and household items, plus technology and toys, in preparation for the holiday season. As we get closer to November 24, the deals will heat up and speed up, so look for sales on laptops, gaming devices, small appliances, and kid-friendly brands like Barbie and Lego.</p><h3>What kind of Black Friday deals were there last year?</h3><p>Last year there were huge sales on must-have products, like the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Samsung 55-inch The Frame Smart TV</a> on Amazon, which was going for $500 off its sale price. Dyson ran Black Friday deals on cordless vacuums, Apple lowered its prices on Airpods, Mac Books, and iPads, and big box stores like Target and Walmart slashed prices on nearly everything from tech to toys, apparel, and appliances in anticipation of the season.</p><h3>How to get a good deal on Black Friday</h3><p>If you’re searching for a specific product, there are ways to keep tabs on all the Black Friday offerings without getting totally overwhelmed. Sign up for emails from stores you love, set Google alerts for brands and stores you shop at, search by model number on electronics, and pay attention to your junk mail or promotions folder in your inbox, just in case sale announcements end up misfiled.</p><h3>Where to find early Black Friday deals</h3><p>If you’re looking for early Black Friday deals, you can find plenty of them both online and in stores. Check larger retailers like Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon, and Best Buy, and don’t forget your local mom-and-pop shops that might be holding sales early. You can find early Black Friday deals all around, so if you know your wish list, it doesn’t hurt to check out your favorite brands and shops beforehand.</p><h3>What is a Black Friday Sale?</h3><p>A Black Friday sale is traditionally when retailers offer considerable discounts on popular products. Black Friday sales used to start at midnight after Thanksgiving and run often until December 24 of that year. In today’s saturated market, Black Friday sales may start for some retailers in the last week of October and continue through December.</p><h3>Why is it called Black Friday?</h3><p>This colloquial term for what some retailers consider the biggest shopping day of the year, the day after Thanksgiving, heralds the start of the winter holiday season centered, for many, around gift giving. There are many theories and myths about why the Friday after Thanksgiving got its name. Probably most popular among them is that companies operating in the red prior to the day would be back in the black once holiday shopping got underway.</p><p>Historians, however, note that “Black Friday” comes from Philadelphia, where the Army-Navy football game was played in the 1950s-1970s, the Friday after Thanksgiving. The crowds arriving for the game were colossal, and the police who patrolled and corralled the crowds called it “Black Friday.” Still, the retailers in Philadelphia benefitted from the consumer traffic who, before and after the game, indulged in holiday shopping in the city, also eventually referring to the day as “Black Friday.”</p><p>By the 1980s, the name had stuck in the public’s imagination as the start of retail shopping, and has been around ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8SaqaWxXZe5oq%2FKZp2roZSWxm6wxJqjrGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fearly-black-friday-deals.html&text=Best%20Early%20Black%20Friday%20Deals%20to%20Kick%20Off%20Holiday%20Shopping&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fearly-black-friday-deals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fearly-black-friday-deals.html&title=Best%20Early%20Black%20Friday%20Deals%20to%20Kick%20Off%20Holiday%20Shopping" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fearly-black-friday-deals.html&title=Best%20Early%20Black%20Friday%20Deals%20to%20Kick%20Off%20Holiday%20Shopping" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fearly-black-friday-deals.html&title=Best%20Early%20Black%20Friday%20Deals%20to%20Kick%20Off%20Holiday%20Shopping" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fearly-black-friday-deals.html&description=Best%20Early%20Black%20Friday%20Deals%20to%20Kick%20Off%20Holiday%20Shopping" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gears-5-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gears 5 Review: Multiplayer Outshines a Fine Campaign Mode">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./august.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened on August 6">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
